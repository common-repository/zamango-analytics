== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it obligatory to use v.2.8+ of Wordpress? Will pluging work on older wordpress builds? =

Zamango Analytics uses few features which were implemented in WordPress v.2.8.0 so it will not work correctly on older versions.
Althought I use it myself on wordpress 2.7.4 with few limitaions.

= Where does plugin display my stats? =

It is very hard to add stats reports to the plugin. In order to keep it fast, plugin just inserts tracking codes to the wordpress pages, so you only can view your reports through apropriate tracking systems.
